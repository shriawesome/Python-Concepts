1. Abstract Classes :
  * An abstract class can be considered as a blueprint for other classes.
  * It allows you to create a set of methods that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract class.
  * It can be used to define a common API for a set of subclasses. This capability is especially useful in a situation where a third-party is going to provide implementations, such as plugins etc.
  * Python does not provide inbuilt support for abstract class.
  * It comes with a module named abc(Abstract Base Class) for the purpose.
  * Important modules :-
    * `from abc import ABCMeta,abstractmethod`
